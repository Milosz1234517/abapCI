1. Automatic unit test runs 
After each activation of an development package an unit test run for this package (or the entire project - see Issue TBD) is started. 
The result of this test runs can be viewed in the two Eclipse views: "ABAP Continuous Integration" and "ABAP CI Dashboard".
The former shows the result of the test run in detail the latter shows a compact summary. 

2. Different coloring for the ABAP projects 
This feature tries to get the well known SAP GUI coloring for different projects into Eclipse. In the Eclipse view "ABAP Colored projects" a color can be defined for each Project. The development objects are marked with the assigned color to the project they belong to. 
Currently only a part of all development objects are colored, eg.: classes, function modules, cds views.
